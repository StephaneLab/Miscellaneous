Curiosities, old things, ...
1) An archive of GNU-Step / AFTERSTEP old XPM icons. Found on a CD of the Slackware 3.3 distribution from september 1997. May be of some use, so I provide them here, I suppose their original licence is GPL.
2) An archive of OpenLook icons patiently extracted from screeshots from the web.
